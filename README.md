# Nerf Sentry Gun

## About
This project was my personal attempt at designing software to control a Nerf gun I had mounted to two servos to detect and shoot at targets.

The project was inspired by [Project Sentry Gun](https://sites.google.com/a/rudolphlabs.com/project-sentry-gun/home "Project Sentry Gun Home") however I wanted to design and make the software on my own.

Currently can track multiple targets whilst shooting at one. Designed to work with the Xbox Kinect.
